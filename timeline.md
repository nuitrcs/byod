# Creating a Project Timeline

You've got 8 weeks with your group.  What are you looking to accomplish overall and each week?  Creating a project plan will help you get clear about what you're looking to accomplish and keep you on track this summer.

## Pre-planning

How many hours per week do you realistically have for the project?  Are there weeks where you know you will have less or no time?

What specific items are you looking to create?  A data visualization?  A script to run an analysis?  A clean dataset?  Think about what files the directory on your computer for this project looks like at the end.  Remember, you want: raw data set > cleaning/processing scripts > clean data set > analysis and visualization scripts > output artifacts such as plots or tables.

## Write the Steps

For each item you want to create, write an ordered list of tasks you think you need to complete to create that item.  Do your best - you may not know all of the steps when you're taking on a new type of project.  Your mentors are happy to help you fill in the gaps and identify steps you may be missing.  

These tasks will be specific to your project and experience level, but here are two examples:

*Create a data visualization:*

* Explore data to check for erroneous and missing values.
* Write data cleaning script that produces clean data file.  
* Complete ggplot2 tutorial/workshop.
* Explore different graph types.
* Choose final plot and polish style and formatting.
* Write clean data processing script.
* Write clean script to produce final graph.
* Document scripts.

*Scrape a website:*

* Basic Python or R workshop/course.
* Webscraping workshop/course.  
* Determine webscraping strategy: what tools are needed and how to traverse the site.
* Install packages and tools.
* Write and test code to collect and save initial pages. (Map out then write the functions)
* Learn about CSS and xpath selectors.  Tutorial on parsing package/library.
* Write and test code to extract links from initial pages.  
* Write and test code to collect secondary pages.  (Map out then write the functions)
* Add code to handle errors and timeouts.  
* Estimate how long collection will take at respectful speed.  
* Learn how to deploy collection code on server/Quest.
* Deploy code on server/Quest.
* Extract information from secondary pages and create a CSV file.
* Check dataset for errors and cleanup processing scripts.
* Document scripts and created dataset.

If you already know you need to take a workshop, complete a tutorial, or learn a specific skill to complete a step, add a pre-requisite step for that learning activity.  Not sure what you may need to learn?  Factor that into your time estimates below.



## Create a Timeline

For each step above, estimate the amount of time you think it will take you.  For example:

*Create a data visualization:*

* Explore data to check for erroneous and missing values.  *4 hours (need to practice dplyr)*
* Write data cleaning script that produces clean data file.  *10 hours (need to get better at recoding values)*
* Complete ggplot2 tutorial/workshop.  *3 hours*
* Explore different graph types.  *3 hours + 4 hours learning the ggplot2 code for them*
* Choose final plot and polish style and formatting.  *3 hours*
* Write a clean version of the data processing script.  *3 hours initially + 3 hours to incorporate feedback*
* Write a clean version of the script to produce final graph.  *3 hours initially + 3 hours to incorporate feedback*
* Document scripts.  *4 hours*

Now, for scheduling, double all of the time estimates you wrote down initially.  Really.  With these doubled times, map your specific tasks (across the full set of items you are aiming to create) to each week, taking into consideration how much time you have available each week.  

Were your goals for the summer reasonable?  If not, what part of the project can you complete by the end of August?  Focus on just that part and try to ignore the rest for now - you can't do everything at once.
