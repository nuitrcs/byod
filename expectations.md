# Program Expectations

## Attendance

You are expected to attend all of the weekly group meetings.  If you miss more than 2, your group members may ask you to leave the group.

For summer, the weekly meetings will run the week of July 6th through the week of August 24th.  

## Participation

We expect you to engage with your group members, ask and answer questions, and provide encouragement and support.  


## Scope of Help

You are responsible for work on your project.  The RCS staff and student consultants will provide advice, direction, and feedback, and point you to learning resources.  We will not write scripts or do analysis for you.  We cannot tell you what the right statistical or analysis model is for your data.  We can help you with what models might work and when your data might be violating some of the assumptions, but it's up to you to choose the analysis methods for your data.  If you need statistical advice, we suggest consulting with a statistician.
