# Weekly Meetings

Working groups are welcome to deviate from this format.  This is a place to start.

## Roundtable

Round 1: One sentence on how you're doing.

Round 2: What was the goal for last week?  Did you accomplish it?  What went well and/or poorly?  What issues do you want to discuss later?

Round 3: What is the goal for next week?  What help do you need?


Hold off discussion/help until the roundtable is over.  


## Group Discussion

Were there common themes?  Is someone encountering an issue that others are likely to have or deal with later?  Does someone have an problem that others want to discuss?

Focus on topics that are of relevance to the group.  1:1 help, from the group leader or from peers, can be discussed outside of the group meeting.
