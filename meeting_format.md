# Weekly Meetings

Working groups are welcome to deviate from this format.  This is a place to start.

## Roundtable

Round 1

* How are you doing in general?  Non-research/work stuff affects projects too!
* What was the goal for last week?  Did you accomplish it?  
* What went well and/or poorly?  What issues do you want to discuss later?

Round 2

* What is the goal for next week?  
* What help do you need?
* Anything you want to discuss?

Hold off more involved discussion/help until the roundtable is over.  


## Group Discussion

Were there common themes?  Is someone encountering an issue that others are likely to have or deal with later?  Does someone have a problem that others want to discuss?

Focus on topics that are of relevance to the group.  One-on-one help, from the group leader or from peers, can be discussed outside of the group meeting.
