### Have a Question?

Post it on Slack (you'll receive an invite to a Slack space).  You can use the #general channel to reach everyone in the program, or the channel for your group to reach just your group members.  Maybe someone else can help.  If you don't get a response, you can message Christina or Colby on Slack.

If you need to send a private message to Christina or Colby, you can use Slack or email.


### Going to miss a meeting?

Please let your group know on your group's channel on Slack.  

If you miss more than 2 weekly meetings during the program, your group members may ask you to leave the group.
