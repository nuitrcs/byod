### Have a Question?

Post it on Slack (you'll receive an invite to a Slack space).  Maybe someone else can help.  If you don't get a response, you can message Christina or Colby as needed.  

### Going to miss a meeting?

Please let your group know on your group's channel on Slack.  

If you miss more than 2 weekly meetings during the program, your group members may ask you to leave the group.
